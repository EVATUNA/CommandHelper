I cannot be your friend and your flatterer too
I think the only reason one loves, monsieur, is for his own pleasure
I want to die knowing one more thing
Idle folks lack no excuses
Idle men are dead all their life long
Idleness is the mother of all evil
Idleness rusts the mind
If an ass bray at you, don't bray at him
If ifs and ans were pots and pans
If in the morning I learn of the truth, I shall die without regrets in the evening
If my aunt had been a man, she'd have been my uncle
If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch
If the shoes fits, wear it
If the sky falls, we shall catch larks
If the staff be crooked, the shadow cannot be straight
If the wind will not serve, take to the oars
If there were no clouds, we should not enjoy the sun
If things were to be done twice all would be wise
If we can't as we would, we must do as we can
If wishes were horses, beggars might ride
If you agree to carry the calf, they'll make you carry the cow
If you cannot bite, never show your teeth
If you cannot have the best, make the best of what you have
If you dance you must pay the fiddler

If you're not stingy, you're not wealthy, and if you're not wealthy, you're not stingy
Ill weeds grow apace
Ill-gotten gains never prosper
Ill-gotten, ill-spent
In a calm sea every man is a pilot
In every beginning think of the end
In for a penny, in for a pound
In juries we write in marble; kindness in dust
In the country of the blind one-eyed man is a king
In the end things will mend
In the evening one may praise the day
In the looking glass we see the form, in wine the heart
In travelling, company; in life, sympathy
In vain he craves advice that will not follow it
Iron hand in a velvet glove
Iron not used soon rusts
It does no pay to be short tempered
It is a foolish sheep that makes the wolf his confession
It is a good horse that never stumbles
It is a long lane that has no turning
It is a poor mouse that has only one hole
It is a silly fish, that is caught twice with the same bait
It is always time to do good
It is an ill bird that fouls its own nest
It is an ill wind that blows nobody good
It is easy to swim if another hoids up your chin
It is enough to make a cat laugh
It is good fishing in troubled waters
It is good to have friends but bad to need them
It is harder to unlearn than to learn
It is love that makes the world go round
It is more blessed to give than to receive
It is never too late to learn
It is no use crying over spilt milk
It is the first step that costs
It never rains but it pours
It takes all sorts to make a world
It's as broad as it's long
It's easier to fall than to get on your feet
It's no use pumping a dry well
It's one thing to flourish and another to fight
It's time to wink as well as to see
Jack of all trades is the master of none
Jackdaw in peacock's feathers
Jest with an ass and he will flap you in the face with his tail
Judge not of men or things at first sight
Just as the twig is bent, the tree is inclined
Justice will assert itself
Keep a thing seven years and you will find a use for it
Keep not two tongues in one mouth
Keep oaring
keep the common road, and you are safe
Keep your mouth shut and your ears open
Kill not the goose that lays the golden eggs
Kill one with kindness
Kill two birds with one stone
Kind hearts are more than coronets
Kind words are worth much and they cost little
Knave is one knave, but a fool is many
Knowing characters is worry and trouble
Knowledge has no enemy but ignorance
Knowledge in youth is wisdom in age
Knowledge is power
Last, but not least
Late fruit keeps well
Laugh and grow fat
Laugh and the world laugh with you; weep, and you weep alone
Law catches flies, but lets hornets go free
Law makers should not be law breakers
Learn to creep before you leap
Learn to say before you sing
Learn wisdom by the follies of others
Learning makes a good man better and an ill man worse
Learning without thought is labour lost
Least said, soonest mended
Leave a welcome behind you
Leave well enough alone
Leaves without figs
Lend your money and lose your friend
Let bygones be bygones
Let every man praise the bridge he goes over
Let every tub stand on its own bottom
Let everyone keep off the flies with the own tail
Let everyone sweep before his own doors
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let well alone
Let your nose go in front, but don't always follow it
Liars need good memories
Liberality is not giving largely, but wisely
Lies have short legs
Life admits not of delays
Life has no pleasure nobler than that of friendship
Life is but a span
Life is compared to a voyage
Life is full of ups and downs
Life is half spent before we know what it is
Life is made up of little things
Life is not a bed of roses
Life is not all beer and skittles
Light come, light go
Lightly come, lightly go
Lightly won, lightly held
Lightning never strikes twice in the same place
Like a cat on hot bricks
Like a needle in a haystack
Like attracts like
Like back and expectorate
Like begets like
Like cures like
Like draws to like
Like father, like son
Like for like
Like he's bewitched by a goblin
Like master, like man
Like mother, like daughter
Like parents, like children
Like priest, like people
Like teacher, like pupil
Listen to what is well said even from an enemy
Little chips light great fires
Little drops of water make the mighty ocean
Little knowledge is a dangerous thing
Little pigeons can carry great messages
Little pitchers have long ears
Little pot is soon hot
Little said soon amended
Little strokes fell great oaks
Little thieves are hanged, but great ones escape
Little things amuse little minds
Live and learn
Live and let live
Live not to eat, but eat to live
Live to learn and learn to live
Lock the stable after the horse is stolen
Long absent, soon forgotten
Look after the pence and the pounds will look after themselves
Look before you leap
Look on the bright side
Lookers-on see more than players
Lord helps those who help themselves
Lost time is never found again
Love cannot be forced
Love conquers all
Love in a cottage
Love is blind, as well as hatred
Love laughs at a distance
Love levels with all
Love little and love long
Love me, love my dog
Love shortens distance
Love will creep where it may not go
Loves makes all hearts gentle
Luck comes to those who look after it
Lying and stealing are next door neighbours
Make haste slowly
Make hay while the sun shines
Make or mar
Make yourself all honey, and the flies will devour you
Man can climb to the highest summits, but he can not dwell there long
Man can do no more than he can
Man is but a reed, the weakest in nature, but he s a thinking reed
Man is made great or little by his own will
Man proposes but God disposes
Man, know thyself
Man's best candle is his understanding
Man's life is a progress, and not a station
Many a fine dish has nothing on it
Many a good cow has a bad calf
Many a good father has but a bad son
Many a little makes a mickle
Many a true word is spoken in jest
Many drops make shower
Many grains of sand will sink a ship
Many hands make light work
Many men, many minds
Many strokes fell great oaks
Many words hurt more than swords
Many words will not fill a bushel
Marriages are made in heaven
Measure for measure
Measure thrice and cut once
Men are blind in their own causes
Men may meet but mountains never
Mend or end
Mend the barn after the horse is stolen
Might goes before right
Mind unemployed is mind unenjoyed
Mingle your joys sometimes with your earnest occupation
Misfortune is a good teacher
Misfortune seldom comes alone
Misfortunes tell us what fortune is
Money begets money
Money changes hands
Money does not grow on trees
Money has no smell
Money is a good servant but a bad master
Money is round and rolls away
Money often unmakes the men who make it
Money spent on the brain is never spent in vain
Money will do anything
More haste, less speed
Mouth in the heart
Much ado about nothing
Much will have more
Muck and money go together
Murder will out
My house burned up, but do died the bedbugs
My house is my castle
Naked came we into the world and naked shall we depart from it
Name not a rope in his house that was hanged
Nature admits not a lie
Nature is the best physician
Near neighbor is better than a distant cousin
Necessity has no law
Necessity is the mother of invention
Necessity knows no law
Neck and neck
Neck or nothing
Need makes the old wife trot
Needs must when the devil drives
Neither fish nor flesh
Neither here nor there
Neither praise nor dispraise yourself; your actions serve the turn
Neither rhyme nor reason
Never buy a pig in a poke
Never cackle till your egg is laid
Never cast dirt into that fountain of which you have sometime drunk
Never do things by halves
Never fry a fish till it's caught
Never is a long word
Never judge by appearance
Never offer to teach fish to swim
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today
Never quit certainty for hope
Never swap horses crossing a stream
Never too late to mend
Never too much of a good thing
Never too much of anything
Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you
Never try to prove what nobody doubts
Never write what you dare not sign
New brooms sweep clean
New lord, new laws
News travels fast
Night gives counsel
Nightingales will not sing in a cage
No cross, no crown
No flying from fate
No gains without pains
No garden without its weeds
No great loss without some small gain
No herb will cure love
No joy without alloy
No joy without alloy
No life without pain
No living man all things can
No longer pipe, no longer dance
No man can tell what future brings forth
No man goes carelessly by a place where profit lips
No man is a hero to his valet
No man is born wise or learned
No man is wise at all times
No man loves his fetters, be they made of gold
No medicine can cure folly
No mill, no meal
No morning sun lasts a whole day
No news is good news
No one spits on money
No pains, no gains
No reward without toil
No root, no fruit
No rose, without a thorn
No rule without exception
No smoke without fire
No song, no supper
No sweet without sweat
No two minds think alike
No wisdom like silence
No wonder lasts more than nine days
No work, no money
Non but a wise man can employ leisure well
None but the brave deserves the fair
None is deceived but he who trusts
None so blind as those who won't see
None so deaf as those that won't hear
Not the slightest hint to the liver
Nothing comes amiss to a hungry man
Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing comes out of the sack but what was in it
Nothing costs so much as what is given to us
Nothing great is easy
Nothing is impossible to a willing heart
Nothing must be done hastily but killing of fleas
Nothing so bad, as not to be good for something
Nothing succeeds like success
Nothing venture, nothing have
Novelty is the great parent of pleasure
Nurture passes nature
Oaks may fall when reeds stand the storm
Of the dead and absent speak well, or not at all
Of two evils choose the least
Old birds are not caught with chaff
Old friends and old wine are best
Old men are twice children
On Shank's mare
Once a beggar, always a beggar
Once a heel, always a heel
Once bitten, twice shy
Once is no rule
One beats the bush, and another catches the bird
One cannot eat one's cake and have it
One cannot put back the clock
One cannot touch pitch without being defiled
One chick keeps a hen busy
One drop of poison infects the whole tun of wine
One evil breeds another
One fire drives out another
One good turn deserves another
One hand washes the other
One hour today is worth two tomorrow
One law for the rich, and another for the poor
One lie makes many
One link broken, the whole chain is broken
One man, no man
One man's meat is another man's poison
One may as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb
One misfortune calls another
One murder makes a villain, millions a hero
One must lie on the bed one has made
One of these days is none of these days
One picture is worth a thousand words
One scabby sheep will mar a whole flock
One shoe will not fit every foot
One swallow does not make a summer
One today is worth two tomorrow
Only the weather knows where the shoe pinches
Open not your door when the devil knocks
Opinions differ
Opportunity makes the thief
Out of sight, out of mind
Out of the flying pan into the fire
Out of the mouth comes evil
Over shoes, over boots
Overdone is worse than undone
Packed like herrings
Pain and death are apart of life
Pain past is pleasure
Patience is a plaster for all sores
Patience is genius
Patience wears out stones
Pay condolences when the lord's horse dies but not when the lord dies
Peace is the fairest form of happiness
Penny wise and pound foolish
Pichers have ears
Pity is akin to love
Pleasure has a sting in its tail
Plenty is no plague
Politeness costs little, but yields much
Poor and liberal, rich and covetous
Popular opinion is the greatest lie in the world
Possession is nine points of the law
Poverty brings stupidity
Poverty is no sin
Poverty is not a shame, but the being ashamed of it is
Practice makes perfect
Practise what you preach
Praise is not pudding
Prefer loss to unjust gain
Presents keep friendship warm
Prevention is better than cure
Pride goes before a fall
Pride will have a fall
Procrastination is the thief of time
Profit all mankind
Promise is debt
Promise little, but do much
Prosperity makes friends, and adversity tries them
Pull down on your hat on the wind side
Punish yourself, abandon yourself
Purpose is what gives life a meaning
Put not your hand between the bark and the tree
Quarreling is the weapon of the weak
Rain at seven, fine at eleven
Rats desert a sinking ship
Reading makes a full man
Reading without purpose is sauntering, not exercise
Remove an old tree and it will die
Repentance is good, but innocence is better
Resolve lasts three days
Respect is greater from a distance
Respect yourself, or no one else will respect you
Riches serve a wise man, and govern a fool
Rise with the Sun and enjoy the day
Rivers need a spring
Roll my log and I will roll yours
Rome was not built in a day
Salt water and absence wash away love
Saying and doing are two things
Score twice before you cut once
Scornful dogs will eat dirty puddings
Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
Second thoughts are best
Secret of success is constancy to purpose
See one and know ten
Seeing is believing
Seldom seen, soon forgotten
Self done is well done
Self is a bad counsellor
Self-praise is no recommendation
Set a beggar on horseback and he'll ride to the devil
Set a thief to catch a thief
Set every man to do what he was made for
Shallow streams make most din
Shoemaker's wives are worst shod
Short debts make long friends
Silence gives consent
Silks and stains put out the fire in the kitchen
Since Adam was a boy
Sink or swim!
Six of one and half a dozen of the other
Slow and steady wins the race
Slow but sure
Slow to resolute, but in performance quick
Small is the seed of every greatness
Small rain lays great dust
Small sorrows speak; great ones are silent
Snow is the poor man's fertilizer
So got, so gone
So many countries, so many customs
So many men, so many minds
Soft fire makes sweet malt
Some are wise, but some are otherwise
Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark 
Soon learnt, soon forgotten
Soon ripe, soon rotten
Sorrow is laughter's daughter
Sour grapes
Sow the wind and reap the whirlwind
Spare the rod, and spare the child
Speak of the devil and he will appear
Speech is silver but silence is gold
Standers-by see more than gamesters
Stay cool but don't freeze
Step after step, the ladder is ascended
Still waters run deep
Stolen pleasures are sweetest
Store is no sore
Stretch your arm no further than your sleeve will reach
Stretch your legs according to the coverlet
Strike while the iron is hot
Stuff today and starve tomorrow
Success is never blamed
Such carpenters, such chips
Such master, such servant
Sweep before your own door
Sweet discourse makes short days and nights
Sweet sixteen and never been kissed
Take away the case and the effect must cease
Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves
Take time by the forelock
Take us as you find us
Take, have, and keep are pleasant words
Talk of the devil, and he is bound to appear
Tarred with the same brush
Tastes differ
Tell that to the marines
That cock won't fight
That which one least anticipates soonest comes to pass
That's a horse of another colour
That's like putting a fifth wheel to a coach
That's the way the cookie crumbles
That's where the shoe pinches!
The angry man opens his mouth and shuts his eyes
The beggar may sing before the thief
The belly has no ears
The best fish smell when they are three days old
The best fish swim near the bottom
The best is oftentimes the enemy of the good
The best looking glass is an old friend
The best means of destroying an enemy is to make him your friend
The best of plans is to run away
The best of the sport is to do the deed and say nothing
The best things in life are free
The biter is sometimes bit
The burden is light on the shoulders of others
The busiest man finds the most leisure
The camel going to seek horns lost his ears
The cap fits
The cask savours of the first fill
The cat shuts its eyes when stealing cream
The cat would eat fish and would not wet her paws
The chain is no stronger than its weakest link
The cobbler should stick to his last
The cobbler's wife is the worst shod
The company makes the feast
The darkest hour is that before the dawn
The darkest place is under the candlestick
The day's plan should made out early in the morning
The devil is not so black as he is painted
The devil knows many things because he is old
The devil lurks behind the cross
The devil rebuking sin
The dogs bark, but the caravan goes on
The Dutch have taken Holland !
The early bird catches the worm
The ebb will fetch off what the tide brings in
The end crowns the work
The end justifies the means
The evils we bring on ourselves are hardest to bear
The exception proves the rule
The face is the index of the mind
The falling out of lovers is the renewing of love
The fat is in the fire
The filth under the white snow the sun discovers
The first blow is halfly the battle
The first step is always the hardest
The first step is the hardest
The flame is not far away from the smoke
The fortune of the house stands by its virtue
The fortune teller cannot tell his our fortune
The fowl knows the serpent's sneeze
The frog in the well knows nothing of the great ocean
The frog will jump back into the pool although it sits on a golden stool
The furthest way about is the nearest way home
The game is not worth the candle
The getting out of the door is the greatest part of the journey
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
The greatest rivers must run into the sea
The greatest talkers are always the least doers
The heart that once truly loves never forgets
The higher the ape goes, the more he shows his tail

The last five minutes determine the issue
The last straw breaks the camel's back
The leopard cannot change its spots
The longest day has an end
The longest night must end
The merry in heart have a continual feast
The mill cannot grind with the water that is past
The mind makes heaven of hell and hell of heaven
The moon does not heed the barking of dogs
The moon's not seen where the sun shines
The more haste, the less speed
The more laws, the more offenders
The more noble, the more humble
The more the merrier
The more violent the storm the sooner it is over
The more you get, the more you want
The morning sun never lasts a day
The mountain has brought forth a mouse
The nearer the bone, the sweeter the flesh
The net of the sleeper catches fish
The new broom sweeps right
The old forget; the young don't know
The only way to have a friend is to be one
The pen is mightier than the sword
The pitcher goes often to the well but is broken at last
The pleasures of the mighty are the tears of the poor
The pot calls the kettle black
The price of your hat isn't the measure of your brain
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The receiver is as bad as the thief
The remedy is worse than the disease
The richer get richer and the poor get babies
The rotten apple injures its neighbours
The scalded dog fears cold water
The second word makes the quarrel
The sickness of the body may prove the health of the mind

The tailor makes the man
The tongue is boneless but it breaks bones
The tongue of idle persons is never idle
The used key is always bright
The voice of one man is the voice of no one
The way to hell is paved with good intentions
The wind cannot be caught in a net
The work shows the workman
The wrong doer never lacks a pretext
The yellow dog is brother of the wolf
There are lees to every wine
There are more ways to the wood than one
There is a place for everything, and everything in its place
There is an eternal bliss in a momentary kiss
There is love downward but no love upward
There is more than one way to kill a cat
There is no fire without smoke
There is no place like home
There is no rose without a thorn
There is no royal road to learning
There is no rule without an exception
There is no smoke without fire
There is truth in wine
There's many a slip 'tween the cup and the lip
There's no joy in anything unless we share it
There's no use crying over spilt milk
They are hand and glove
They must hunger in winter that will not work in summer
Things done cannot be undone
Things past cannot be recalled
Think today and speak tomorrow
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Throw the baby out with the bath water
Tighten your helmet strings in victory
Time and tide wait for no man
Time cures all things
Time discloses all things
Time flies like an arrow and time lost never returns
Time is money
Time is the best counsellor
Time is the great healer
Time tries truth
Time works wonders
To add fuel to the fire

Tomorrow come never
Too many books make us ignorant
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Too much knowledge makes the head bald
Too much of a good thing is good for nothing
Too much water drowned the miller 
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
Translators, traitors
True blue will never stain
True coral needs no painter's brush
Truth comes out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
Truth is lost by too much controversy
Truth is stranger than fiction
Truth is the best advocate
Truth lies at the bottom of a well
Try a horse by riding him; try a man by associating with him
Two blacks do not make a white
Two dogs strive for a bone, and a third runs away with it
Two heads are better than one
Two in distress make trouble less
Two is company, but three is none
Variety is the spice of life
Velvet paws hide sharp claws
Virtue is its own reward
Visits should be short like a Winter's day
Wait for the cat to jump
Walls have ears
Wash your dirty linen at home
Waste not, want not
Water is boon in the desert, but the drowning curses it
We all have enough strength to bear the misfortunes of others
We are born crying, live complaining, and die disappointed
We are the authors of our own disasters
We cannot come to honour under coverlet
We die but once
We know not what is good until we have lost it
We must live as we can, not as we would
We never know the value of water till the well is dry
We shall see what we shall see
We sink to rise
We soon believe what we desire
Wealth is nothing without health
Well begun is half done
Well fed, well bred
What can't be cured, must be endured
What comes from the heart goes to the heart
What is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh
What is done by night appears by day
What is done cannot be undone
What is got over the devil's back is spent under his belly
What is learned in the cradle is carried to the grave
What is lost is lost
What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
What is worth doing at alt is worth doing well
What much is worth comes from the earth
What must be, must be
What the heart thinks, the mouth speaks
What we do willingly is easy
Whatever you undertake, think of the end
What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
What's yours is mine, and what's mine is my own
When angry count ten; when very angry, a hundred
When angry, count a hundred
When at Rome, do as the Romans do
When children stand quiet, they have done some harm
When flatterers meet, the devil goes to dinner
When friends meet
When god closes one door, he opens another
When guns speak it is too late to argue
When in Rome, do as the romans do
When one door shuts, another opens
When pigs fly
When Queen Anne was alive
When the calf is drowned they cover the well
When the cat is away, the mice will play
When the devil is blind
When the fox preaches, take care of your geese
When the pinch comes, you remember the old shoe
When the well is full, it will run over
When three know it, alt know it
When wine is in wit is out
When you are good to others, you are best to yourself
Where there is a will, there is a way
Where there is life, there is hope
Where three travel together, one will be my teacher
While the grass grows the horse starves
While there is life, there is hope
Who breaks, pays
Who has never tasted bitter, knows not what is sweet
Who holds the purse rules the house
Who keeps company with the wolf, will learn to howl
Wisdom is more to be envied than riches
Wisdom may come out of the mouths of babes
Wise after the event
With time and patience the leaf of the mulberry becomes satin
Without a friend to share them, no goods we posses are rally enjoyable
Without patronage art is like a windmill without wind
Words are the voice of the heart
Words pay no debts
You and I draw both in the same yoke
You can take a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink
You cannot eat your cake and have it
You cannot flay the same ox twice
You cannot judge a tree by it bark
You cannot teach old dogs new tricks
You cannot wash charcoal white
You can't ear your cake and have it
You can't hold a candle to the sun
You can't seek Lady Luck; Lady Luck seeks you
You can't tell a book by its cover
You made your bed, now lie in it
You may go farther and fare worse
You may take a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink
You never miss the water till the well runs dry
You're never too old to learn
You're not the Lone Ranger
Zeal without knowledge is a runaway horse
