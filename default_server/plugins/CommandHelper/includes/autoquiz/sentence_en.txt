I'll see you in dreamland
I'm affectionate for you.
I'm afraid I can't.
I'm afraid. I've no idea.
I'm beat
I'm bushed
I'm dead on my feet
I'm dead-tired
I'm disinterested in that.
I'm dog tired
I'm done
I'm dragging
I'm exhausted
I'm flat out tired
I'm freaking hungry!
I'm going to investigate that further.

I'm really booked.
I'm running on empty
I'm running on fumes
I'm slammed.
I'm sleepy
I'm so hungry I could eat a scabby horse.

I'm weary
I'm wild about you.
I'm worn out
I've got you under my skin.
I've had enough.
I'd rather not, thanks.
I'm head over heels for you.
I'm infatuated with you.
I'm not able to commit to that right now.
I'm not really into it, but thanks for asking!
Is there anything else we can help you with?
Is this correct?
Is this right?
It doesn't matter.
It is nice to meet you
It is not a good idea for me.
It's a mystery to me.
It's beyond me.
It's ok.
It's such a pleasure to teach when
Keen
Keep in touch
Keep working on it; you're improving.
Knock them dead!
Let me check on that.
Let me repeat that just to make sure?
Look what the cat dragged in!

No problem
No, thanks.
Nope

So do I.
Sorry
Sorry, for being late.
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

Sounds fun, but I'm not available.
Sounds tempting, but I'II have to pass.
Starved
Stay safe
Super-Duper!
Sure I can!
Take it easy
Talk to you later
Teacher, please can you repeat again?
Terrific!
Thank you for staying with us!
Thanks for thinking of me but I can't
Thanks for thinking of me. I really wish I could.
That doesn't work for me.
That is bare sick!
That kind of work makes me happy.
That requires a bit more research first.
That's a good question, but I don't know.
That's a good question, I'II check this.
That's all right.
That's exactly what I'm seeking to answer.
That's it.
That's not an option.
That's not for me.
That's not going to work for me.
That's not my thing.
That's OK.
That's not going to work for me.
The room is too noisy.
There is no need. It's ok.
There's no need to. It's all right.
This is not negotiable.
Time to dream
Tomorrow is not soon enough. Lets prepare.
Tremendous!
Uh-huh
Unfortunately not.
Unfortunately, that's not something I can do at this time.
Until tomorrow
