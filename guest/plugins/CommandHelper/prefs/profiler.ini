# If a profile point took less than this amount of time (in ms) to run, it won't be logged. This is good for reducing 
# data blindness caused by too much data being displayed. Normally you only care about things that took longer than a 
# certain amount, not things that took less than a certain amount. Setting this to 0 will trigger everything.
