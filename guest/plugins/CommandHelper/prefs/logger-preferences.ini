# The logger preferences allow you to granularly define what information
# is written out to file, to assist you in 
# debugging or general logging.
# You may set the granularity of all the tags individually, to any one of
# the following 
# values:
# OFF - Turns off all logging for this module.
# ON - Synonym for ERRORS
# 
# ERROR - Logs errors, or other 
# high importance messages.
# WARNING - Logs warnings and above.
# INFO - Logs informational notices, and above.
# DEBUG 
# - Logs useful debugging information, and above.
# VERBOSE - Logs every little detail.
# 
# 
# In many cases, components 
# will only use the ERROR level, therefore, ON is a synonym.
# However, in some cases, a component may give you more 
# information if you set it lower.
